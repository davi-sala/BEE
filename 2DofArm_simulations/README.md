#Two degree of freedom arms controlled by Liquid State Machines:   
If your are lucky enough the code is going to work and you will be able to see my attempt to reproduce and somehow extend a little bit the work published by Joshi/Maass:  
http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/0899766054026684#.VmHMuOOyOko

Probably it has some (or lots of?) bugs and feel free to correct them ;)
