# SpiNNaker testing
Here I'm running the same (or almost the same, as I could not inject the noisy current) experiment, but using SpiNNaker (Spinn-5).  
  
Total number of neurons: 13500  
Number of inhibitory neurons: 2700  
Number of excitatory neurons: 10800  
Number of inhibitory connections: 6873  
Number of excitatory connections: 24173
